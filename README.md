# Welcome to Challenge 1 for Sophos!

Hi, my name is Diego and I am really excited to present my challenge.


# Files

Inside my project you can find a general structure for a java project.
But in folder **src** there is an utils folder and you can see a Challenge1.java file.

I have two static methods:

- **numberString**:
  This method is waiting for a string that match with **Type A** or **Type B**.
  As a result you are going to get a String that contains ten characters between 0-9.
- **verifyIsPresent**:
  You need to provide a List of String and a String to check it is inside of array and getting a boolean value.
  If String is present in array, you are going to get a False, otherwise your return is True.
